# Alessandro Dell'Orto

I took my Master degree in Physiscs of Complex Systems at University of Torino in July 2020. During these years I developed hard skills in Machine Learning, Game and Network Theory and Numerical Methods. My master thesis focused on modelling evolutionary games on graphs and simulating them numerically. Now I am an Application Developer at Accenture.

### Reddit

Reddit is an entertainment, social networking, and news website where registered community members can submit content, such as text posts or direct links, making it essentially an online bulletin board system. One of the user attributes that is not natively supported by the Reddit platform is the gender. However, in some subreddits, users can self report their genders as part of the subreddit rules. In the scope of this competition, users that self reported their gender are selected from the dataset, and your goal is to predict the gender of these users.

### Titanic

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc). 

### House Pricing

In this challenge you will need to predict the price of the house/flat in Moscow based on various properties to the flat as well as macroeconomic stats of the current situation in Russia.

### Digit Recognizer

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike. In this competition, your goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.
