# Alessandro Dell'Orto

I took my Master degree in Physiscs of Complex Systems at University of Torino in July 2020. During these years I developed hard skills in Machine Learning, Game and Network Theory and Numerical Methods. My master thesis focused on modelling evolutionary games on graphs and simulating them numerically.
